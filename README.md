# Python-Binary-Tree-Traversal

Operations to traverse a binary tree

  ## Traverse pre order tree
  
      1. Visit root node
      2. Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
      3. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
      
  ## Traverse in order tree
  
      1. Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
      2. Visit the root node
      3. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
      
  ## Traverse post order tree
  
      1. Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
      2. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
      3. Visit the root node

## Getting Started

Let's start to use this project.\
There is a python file with the code and a Jupyter Notebook to visualize the code execution in your browser.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 must be installed.

### Installation

To execute the project open the terminal and go to the project folder. Then execute it with python:

```sh
python3 binary_tree.py
```

You can also use Jupyter Notebook to execute it in your browser or text editor directly.
